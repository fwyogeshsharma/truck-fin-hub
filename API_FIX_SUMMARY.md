# API Fix Summary

## Changes Made to Fix the 500 Error

### 1. Database Migration ‚úÖ
- Added missing columns to `users` table:
  - `company_id`
  - `approval_status` (default: 'approved')
  - `approved_by`
  - `approved_at`
  - `rejection_reason`
- Migration endpoint: `POST /api/migrations/add-user-approval-columns`
- Migration has been run successfully

### 2. Enhanced Error Logging
Added detailed console logging to `/api/auth/role` endpoint to help diagnose issues:
- Logs incoming request data
- Logs update data being sent to database
- Logs successful updates
- Logs detailed error messages with stack traces

### 3. Fixed Response Format
Updated the `/api/auth/role` response to include all required fields:
- Added `termsAccepted` and `termsAcceptedAt`
- Added `is_admin`
- Properly returns all approval-related fields

## How to Test

### Step 1: Verify Server is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/companies?active=true
```

### Step 2: Check Database Columns
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/migrations/check-user-columns
```
Should show `"allPresent": true`

### Step 3: Test the Flow
1. Sign up as a new user
2. Accept terms
3. Select "Shipper" role
4. Choose a company from the list
5. Check server console logs for detailed output

### Step 4: Check Server Logs
The server will now print:
```
üìù Update role request received: { userId, role, company, companyId, approvalStatus }
üîÑ Calling updateUser with: { userId, updateData }
‚úÖ User updated successfully: { id, role, company, approval_status }
```

Or if there's an error:
```
‚ùå Update role error: [error message]
Error stack: [stack trace]
```

## What Happens Now

### For Shipper Role:
1. User selects shipper role and company
2. Status is set to 'pending'
3. User is logged out
4. Admin sees request in "Grant Access" card
5. Admin approves/rejects
6. User can login after approval

### For Other Roles:
1. User selects role
2. Status is set to 'approved' (default)
3. User continues to dashboard immediately

## Troubleshooting

If you still see a 500 error:

1. **Check Server Logs** - The detailed logs will show exactly what's failing
2. **Verify User Exists** - Make sure the user is logged in and has a valid session
