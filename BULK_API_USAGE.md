# Bulk Trip Creation API

## Endpoint
```
POST http://localhost:3001/api/trips/bulk
```

## Business Logic
- **Receiver (Consignee)** = Load Owner (the company receiving goods - they need the loan)
- **Sender (Consignor)** = Client Company (the company sending goods) - OPTIONAL
- **Transporter** = Vehicle Owner (transporting the goods)

## Required Fields

## Important Notes
1. **Receiver (Consignee) must exist** in the database with `role='load_owner'`
